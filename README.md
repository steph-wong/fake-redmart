# Fake Redmart

Fake Redmart is a minimalistic replica of e-commerce website Redmart (https://redmart.com/), created as an exercise in RoR.

### Approach Taken

The app includes three basic models - user, product and review - and is not designed to be commercially functional nor aesthetically pleasing. The primary focus was on establishing relationships between models.

App is deployed on: https://mysterious-castle-51227.herokuapp.com/
